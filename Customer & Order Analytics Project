orderid <> 'Order ID';


#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(Product)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';


#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 

SELECT cs.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS cs
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS FB
ON cs.order_id = FB.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';


#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 

SELECT Jan.Product, 
    (SELECT MIN(Price)
        FROM BIT_DB.JanSales AS Jan)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales AS Jan;



#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT SUM(Quantity)*Price as revenue, Jan.product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales AS Jan
GROUP By Product;



#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT Feb.Product, Feb.Location, Feb.Quantity, SUM(quantity)*price as revenue

WHERE Location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT COUNT(cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity)*price AS Average_Price
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales AS Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers as Cust
ON FEB.orderid = cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
